# change-detection-I: matlab and visual basic code for a working memory task

This repo contains my experiment and analysis code for a psychophysics task that tests a subject's visual working memory. 

The "ExperimentCode" folder contains code written in Visual Basic to run the task. 

The "AnalysisCode" folder also contains code written in Matlab for analyzing behavioral data and running five computational models that we considered for this task. 

The "SanityChecks" folder runs several tests to make sure that the models were derived accurately before we fit them to the behavioral data. 

If you want to find out more, feel free to contact me.
